This package is no longer functional.

It has been without a maintainer for a significant period of time,
and is in need of sufficient work that any future coordinated efforts to build
a framework for general extrapolation techniques would be better to start from
scratch.

If you wish to do full sun potential field extrapolations, you should look at
[pfsspy](https://pfsspy.readthedocs.io/).

# solarbextrapolation

solarbextrapolation was a library for extrapolating 3D magnetic fields from line-of-sight magnetograms.
